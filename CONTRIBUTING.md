# Contributing to The Induction Method

First, thank you for considering a contribution. This project is dedicated to a unique mission: to build the first open-source, community-tested playbook for leveraging AI as a true cognitive partner, grounded in a clear cognitive framework. Every contribution, from a typo fix to a full testing report, is immensely valued.

This is a living project. To keep it alive and make it stronger, we need more than just ideas—we need **battlefield intelligence**.

## The Most Valuable Contribution: Become a Battle-Tester

The single most valuable way you can contribute is by **testing our protocols on different AI models.**

Our goal is to create a robust, model-agnostic arsenal of cognitive tools. A prompt that only works on one specific, high-end model is a fragile curiosity. A prompt that has been tested and refined across multiple platforms is a resilient weapon for everyone.

**Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to take our protocols and run them on the AI you have access to.**

-   GPT-4 / GPT-3.5
-   Claude 3 (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
-   Google Gemini
-   DeepSeek
-   Llama 3
-   Mistral
-   Any open-source or niche model you use!

### How to Submit a Testing Report

When you test a protocol, open an "Issue" on GitHub and use the "Testing Report" template. Tell us:

1.  **The Protocol You Tested:** (e.g., "The 3-Horizon Brainstorm")
2.  **The AI Model You Used:** (e.g., "Claude 3 Sonnet")
3.  **The Result:** Did it work as expected? Did it fail? Was the output high-quality?
4.  **Your Feedback:** (Optional but invaluable) Do you have ideas for how to improve it? Did you find a tweak that made it work better on your model?

This feedback is the lifeblood of the project. It helps everyone.

## Other Ways to Contribute

### Suggesting Enhancements or New Protocols
Have an idea for a new playbook or a way to improve an existing one? Open an "Issue" with a clear description of your idea.

### Standard Pull Request Workflow
For direct edits, like fixing typos or improving documentation:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the project.
2.  **Create a Branch:** In your fork, create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `fix/typo-in-readme`).
3.  **Make Your Changes** and write a clear, concise commit message.
4.  **Open a Pull Request:** Push your branch and open a Pull Request back to our `main` branch.

## Code of Conduct

We have one rule: **Be respectful.** We are all here to learn, share, and build something great together. We attack ideas, not people. Constructive feedback is the goal; harassment is not tolerated.

Thank you for helping us forge a more powerful and accessible future for human-AI partnership.
