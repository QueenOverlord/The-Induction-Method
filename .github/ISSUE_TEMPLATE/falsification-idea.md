### **1. The Core Thesis to be Tested**
Please specify which of the project's core theses this experiment will challenge. (e.g., The Specificity Thesis, The Portability Thesis, etc.)

> *[Your answer here]*

---
### **2. The Experimental Hypothesis**
State your hypothesis in a clear, testable "If... then..." format. What do you predict will happen?

> *Example: "If a complex, monolithic prompt (like the Cognitive MRI) is run on a less-capable model, then it will fail to follow the instructions correctly, while a simpler, conversational prompt will succeed."*
>
> *[Your hypothesis here]*

---
### **3. Proposed Methodology**
Briefly describe the steps to conduct this experiment. What protocol would you use? What would you measure?

> *Example: "1. Run the Cognitive MRI prompt on GPT-3.5. 2. Separately, run the Clean Room Protocol prompt on GPT-3.5. 3. Compare the outputs for correctness and adherence to the protocol's structure."*
>
> *[Your proposed steps here]*

---
### **4. Expected Impact**
If your hypothesis is correct, what would this result tell us? How would it help improve The Induction Method?

> *[Your answer here]*

---
### **5. Additional Context**
Add any other context, links, or screenshots that might be helpful in understanding your idea.

> *[Optional: Add any extra details here]*

### **Why This Template is Effective:**

1.  **YAML Frontmatter:** The block at the top automatically sets the title format, description, and labels (`falsification-project`, `enhancement`, `help-wanted`). This keeps your issues organized from the moment they are created. The `help-wanted` label is especially important as it signals to the community that this is an area where you are actively seeking contributions.
2.  **Structured Questions:** It doesn't just ask for an "idea." It forces the contributor to think like a scientist by asking for the **Thesis**, **Hypothesis**, **Methodology**, and **Impact**. This elevates the quality of submissions from simple suggestions to well-thought-out experimental designs.
3.  **Clear Examples:** Providing examples (like in the Hypothesis and Methodology sections) makes it much easier for a new contributor to understand what is expected of them.
4.  **Low Friction:** By providing this clear structure, you make it easy for someone to share a valuable idea without being intimidated. You've done the hard work of structuring the thought process for them.

This template professionalizes your contribution process and makes it far more likely that you will receive high-quality, actionable ideas from the community.
