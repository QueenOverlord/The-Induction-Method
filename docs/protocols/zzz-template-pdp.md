## 3. Field Notes & Best Practices

This section contains practical, hard-won advice for getting the most out of this protocol. It's the "pro tips" section that makes our Champion feel like an insider.

- **Pro-Tip:** [e.g., "For best results on models like GPT-3.5, add the phrase 'Think step-by-step' to the first prompt."]
- **Common Pitfall:** [e.g., "Be careful not to make your initial problem statement too broad, as it can lead to generic output."]
- **Integration Note:** [e.g., "The output of this protocol serves as a perfect input for the `[Another Protocol Name]`."]
