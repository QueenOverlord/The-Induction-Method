# The Falsification Project

### This document is the living heart of our commitment to intellectual honesty. It outlines the core theses of The Induction Method and tracks the ongoing experiments designed to rigorously test, challenge, and potentially disprove them.

#### **Executive Summary**
> **Objective:** To systematically validate the effectiveness of our protocols and ensure our methodology is grounded in empirical evidence, not just theory.
>
> **Use Case:** This document is the central hub for tracking all experimental validation, from informal field tests to structured blind tests.
>
> **Expected Output:** A transparent, up-to-date log of our research, including completed experiments, preliminary findings, and planned future tests.

## 1. Core Theses Under Investigation

This project operates on several core hypotheses. Our primary goal is to validate or invalidate them.

-   **Thesis 1 (The Specificity Thesis):** A highly specific, well-designed AI persona will produce significantly more valuable, accurate, and context-aware output than a generic or broadly defined persona.
-   **Thesis 2 (The Protocol Thesis):** A structured, multi-step protocol for interacting with an LLM will yield more reliable and consistent results than simple, unstructured prompting, especially on complex tasks.
-   **Thesis 3 (The Portability Thesis):** Protocols designed with conversational, single-task steps will be more portable and effective across a wider range of AI models, including less-capable ones.

## 2. Completed Experiments & Preliminary Findings

*This section documents completed tests. Formal documentation and artifacts (like demo GIFs and datasets) are in progress and will be linked here as they are completed.*

### **Experiment 001: The "Cognitive Pressure" Blind Test**

-   **Methodology:** Two outputs were generated for the same complex problem. One used a simple prompt. The other used a "Cognitive Pressure" technique (an early version of our protocol-based approach). Both anonymous outputs were presented to a separate AI instance for a blind evaluation based on clarity, depth, and actionability.
-   **Preliminary Finding:** The AI evaluator consistently and decisively selected the output generated via the "Cognitive Pressure" method as superior. This provides strong initial, albeit anecdotal, evidence for **Thesis 1** and **Thesis 2**.
-   **Status:** Awaiting formal documentation.

### **Experiment 002: The Conversational vs. Monolithic Prompt Test**

-   **Hypothesis:** This experiment will test two competing theses.
    1.  **The Portability Thesis:** Simple, conversational, multi-step prompts (like the Clean Room Protocol) will be more robust and portable across a wide range of AI models, including less-capable ones.
    2.  **The Advanced Model Thesis:** Complex, single-block "monolithic" prompts that contain the entire logic tree (like the Cognitive MRI) will perform better on advanced, frontier models with large context windows, leading to a cleaner, single-prompt user experience.

-   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Part A (Portability):** The conversational **Clean Room Protocol** will be executed on a less-capable, free-tier model (e.g., GPT-3.5).
    2.  **Part B (Advanced):** The monolithic **Cognitive MRI** protocol will be executed on the same less-capable model.
    3.  **Analysis:** The success, failure, and quality of the outputs will be compared. A successful execution in Part A alongside a failure in Part B would provide strong evidence for both theses simultaneously.

-   **Expected Outcome:** We expect the model to successfully navigate the conversational prompt (Part A) but struggle or fail to follow the complex instructions of the monolithic prompt (Part B). This would validate the design choice of using conversational prompts for maximum portability while reserving monolithic prompts for power users with access to frontier models.
-   **Status:** Awaiting execution and creation of demo artifacts.

### **Experiment 003: The Persona Forge Efficacy Test**

-   **Methodology:** A structured test where the "GRC Specialist" persona and a generic "AI Assistant" are given the same five complex security problems. The outputs will be scored by a human expert (or a highly-specialized AI evaluator) against a rubric of accuracy, specificity, and actionable advice.
-   **Status:** Pending execution after Experiment 002.

## A Note on Our Progress & A Call for Allies

This document is a transparent, real-time log of our research. Many informal tests have already been conducted, and their results have shaped the protocols you see today. The current documentation reflects only a fraction of that work; formalizing the rest is my immediate priority.

**This is where you can make a huge impact.** The frontier is too vast to explore alone. If you have an idea for an experiment, a result to share from your own work, or a desire to help formalize these tests, your contribution is invaluable.

► **Join the Mission:** Open an **"🔬 Falsification Idea"** in the Issues tab. Every new test makes the entire system stronger for everyone.
