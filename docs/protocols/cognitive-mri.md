# The Cognitive MRI

### **This protocol prevents your most expensive engineering mistake: wasting months of developer time building the wrong solution to the wrong problem.**

**Executive Summary**
> **Objective:** To deconstruct a complex, ambiguous problem and achieve profound clarity on its true nature *before* attempting to solve it.
> **Use Case:** When facing a vague strategic challenge, a poorly defined project brief, or when you feel stuck and unsure of the real problem.
> **Expected Output:** A bespoke "Council of Agents" tailored to your problem, and a final synthesis report with actionable next steps.

- **A Note from the Frontier: Model Compatibility**
  This is an advanced, multi-step protocol that demands a high level of instruction-following from the AI. In my own tests, I've found that lighter, free models often struggle to maintain the protocol's state, leading to errors. However, I've had excellent results with more capable models like the one powering Manus AI (in chat mode).

  **This is where you, as a fellow explorer, come in.** The landscape of AI models is vast and constantly changing. The most valuable contribution you can make is to test this protocol on the models you have access to.

  ► **Your Mission:** Run this protocol, open a "🔬 Testing Report" in the Issues tab, and tell us what you discover. Your field reports are how we, as a community, will build the definitive map of what works best.

## 1. Strategic Briefing (The "Why")

The "Cognitive MRI" is a diagnostic weapon. Its purpose is to prevent the single most expensive mistake in business: **solving the wrong problem.** Standard brainstorming often fails because it jumps directly to solutions without first validating the problem itself. This protocol forces a deliberate pause. It transforms the AI from a simple "answer machine" into a master diagnostician that helps you find the right questions to ask. For a business, this means saving countless hours and resources by ensuring your team is aimed at the correct target from the very beginning.

## 2. Operational Steps (The "How")

This protocol is a "zero-input" prompt that initiates a dynamic, four-phase dialogue with the AI. Your only task is to paste the prompt and then answer the questions the AI asks you.

### Step 1: Initiate the Dialogue

Copy the Master Prompt below and paste it into your AI interface. **You do not need to edit it.** Just paste it and send.

#### Master Prompt: The Cognitive MRI (v2.0)
> ```
> # MISSION: INITIATE THE COGNITIVE MRI PROTOCOL
>
> You are a master AI Diagnostician. Your purpose is to help me achieve profound clarity about a problem *before* we try to solve it. You will now guide me through a structured, four-phase protocol.
>
> ---
> ### **PHASE 1: THE INTAKE**
>
> Begin now. Your first action is to ask me, "What is the problem or challenge you are facing?"
>
> **Wait for my response.** Do not proceed until I have described my problem.
>
> ---
> ### **PHASE 2: THE DIAGNOSTIC SCAN**
>
> Once I have described my problem, your next action is to begin the Socratic Inquiry. Ask me exactly three powerful, targeted questions designed to force me to clarify my own thinking and reveal the true nature of my problem.
>
> **Do not offer any advice or solutions.** Only ask the three diagnostic questions.
>
> **Wait for my answers.** Do not proceed until I have responded.
>
> ---
> ### **PHASE 3: THE AUTONOMOUS COUNCIL ASSEMBLY**
>
> Once I have answered your questions, analyze all of my previous responses. Identify the core nature of my problem and the perspectives I am missing.
>
> Then, propose a bespoke "Council of Agents" of 3 specialist personas designed to provide those missing perspectives. For each agent, define their Persona and Worldview.
>
> Conclude by asking for my approval to proceed. **Wait for my approval.**
>
> ---
> ### **PHASE 4: THE DEBATE & SYNTHESIS**
>
> Once I grant approval, you will execute a full, multi-round debate between the approved agents.
>
> **Debate Format:**
> 1.  **Round 1: Opening Analysis.**
> 2.  **Round 2: Rebuttal & Critique.**
> 3.  **Round 3: Final Synthesis.** As the master Diagnostician, analyze the debate and provide:
>     - The core insight.
>     - A list of concrete, actionable next steps.
>
> ---
>
> You have your full mission instructions. Begin Phase 1 now by asking me for my problem.
> ```

### Step 2: Describe Your Problem

The AI will ask you for your problem. Describe it in your own words.

### Step 3: Answer the Diagnostic Questions

The AI will ask you three probing questions. Answer them thoughtfully.

### Step 4: Approve the Council & Receive Your Insight

The AI will propose a team of experts. Review the team and, if you agree, simply respond with "Approved. Proceed." The AI will then run the full debate and deliver your final, actionable intelligence report.

## 3. Field Notes & Best Practices

- **Pro-Tip:** The more honest and vulnerable you are in your answers to the diagnostic questions, the more accurate the AI's diagnosis and the more powerful the final result will be.
- **Common Pitfall:** Resisting the AI's questions or trying to jump ahead to a solution. Trust the process. The clarity you gain in Phase 2 is the most valuable part of the entire protocol.
- **Integration Note:** The "actionable next steps" from this protocol's output are perfect for feeding into **"The 3-Horizon Brainstorm"** to generate a massive number of solutions for the now-clarified problem.
- **Industry Equivalents:** This protocol serves the same function as a "Root Cause Analysis," a "5 Whys Exercise," or a "Pre-Mortem," but in a dynamic, AI-driven format. Use these terms to explain its value to leadership.
