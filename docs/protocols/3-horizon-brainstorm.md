# The 3-Horizon Brainstorm

### **This protocol turns a 3-hour brainstorming meeting into a 15-minute, AI-driven process that delivers a prioritized action plan.**

**Executive Summary**
> **Objective:** To systematically generate 100+ creative ideas for a specific problem and prioritize them into an actionable decision matrix.
> **Use Case:** When you need to move beyond incremental thinking and discover breakthrough solutions for product innovation, marketing campaigns, or strategic business challenges.
> **Expected Output:** A clean, multi-tabbed table containing over 100 ideas, sorted by feasibility into "Quick Wins," "Strategic Projects," and "Moonshots."

## 1. Strategic Briefing (The "Why")

Standard brainstorming sessions often fail, resulting in recycled ideas and "brainstorm burnout." This protocol solves that by transforming ideation into a predictable engine. It uses a dynamic AI council tailored to your specific problem and a structured, three-round process to force thinking across different "horizons." Crucially, it concludes not with a messy list, but with a prioritized **Decision Matrix**, turning a chaotic creative process into a reliable system for building a portfolio of actionable, innovative ideas.

## 2. Operational Steps (The "How")

This protocol is a multi-step dialogue with the AI. You will act as the **Protagonist**, defining the problem and making the final decisions, while the AI will act as your adaptive creative council and data organizer.

> **Watch It in Action:** To see how these steps flow together, here is a short demonstration of the entire protocol, from defining the problem to receiving the final Decision Matrix.

### Step 0: Define Your Problem

This is the most important step. You must clearly state the problem you want to solve. Don't worry about perfect "prompting." Just describe the challenge in your own words.

> For your first draft of the problem, it's often easier to speak than to write. Feel free to record a voice note on your phone, use a transcription app, and **paste the raw, unedited text in the step 1 prompt**. AI is designed to handle it.

---

### Step 1: Forge Your Adaptive Council

Now, use the following prompt. **Paste your problem description where indicated**. The AI will analyze your problem and construct a bespoke council, including at least two specialists from your specific domain, before proceeding.

#### Prompt for Step 1: Adaptive Council Forging
> ```
> # MISSION: ASSEMBLE AN ADAPTIVE BRAINSTORM COUNCIL
>
> You are the Facilitator of a "3-Horizon Brainstorm." Your first task is to analyze the user's problem and assemble a bespoke council of 8 expert agents to solve it.
>
> ---
> 
> **THE USER'S PROBLEM:**
> [**<-- PASTE YOUR PROBLEM DESCRIPTION HERE**]
> 
> ---
>
> **YOUR TASK:**
> 1.  **Analyze the Problem:** Read the user's problem and identify the core industry, domain, and challenge.
> 2.  **Assemble the Council:** Based on your analysis, instantiate a council of 8 personas (each persona **must without fails** have a specific title, worldview, and characteristics. This council will include:
>     - **The Protagonist (The User):** Who will be the final decision-maker.
>     - **At least TWO Domain Specialists:** Experts directly relevant to the user's problem (e.g., if the problem is about pet food, you might include a 'Veterinarian' and a 'Pet Supply Chain Expert').
>     - **At least ONE Adjacent Expert:** A professional from a related field (e.g., a 'Direct-to-Consumer Marketer').
>     - **The FOUR "Wild Cards":** A Biologist, a Historian, a Chef, and a Jaded Customer. These are non-negotiable and provide outside perspective.
> 3.  **Propose the Council:** Present the list of the 8 personas you have assembled, briefly explaining why each was chosen.
>
> Conclude by asking for the user's approval of the council. **Do not proceed to brainstorming until you have the user's approval.**
> WRITE THIS IN BOLD FOR THE USER AFTER PRESENTING THE COUNCIL"**COUNCIL ASSEMBLED. NOW, COPY THE STEP 2: 'IDEATION & PRIORITIZATION' PROMPT FROM THE WEBSITE AND PASTE IT TO BEGIN.**" 
> ```

### Step 2: Run the Ideation & Prioritization

Once you approve the council, use this final prompt to execute the rest of the protocol. The AI will handle the ideation rounds and the final table creation.

### Prompt for Step 2: Ideation & Prioritization
> ```
> # MISSION: EXECUTE IDEATION & CREATE DECISION MATRIX
>
> The council is approved. You will now facilitate the three rounds of ideation, generate the ideas, and then structure them into a final Decision Matrix.
>
> ---
> **PART A: THE THREE HORIZONS OF IDEATION**
>
> Facilitate the three rounds of brainstorming with the assembled council.
>
> - **Round 1: Iterative Ideas (Horizon 1)** - Generate 30-40 ideas on how to improve what already exists.
> - **Round 2: Innovative Ideas (Horizon 2)** - Generate 30-40 ideas by combining existing concepts in new ways.
> - **Round 3: Foundational Ideas (Horizon 3)** - Generate 20-30 "moonshot" ideas that challenge core assumptions.
>
> After generating the ideas, list them all, grouped by their horizon. Confirm the total number of ideas is over 100.
>
> ---
> **PART B: THE DECISION MATRIX**
>
> Once the ideas are listed, you will now act as the **Protagonist**. Your task is to review every single idea and assign it a **Feasibility Score (1, 2, or 3)**.
>
> - **Score 3 (Quick Win):** Can be done now.
> - **Score 2 (Strategic Project):** Requires planning.
> - **Score 1 (Moonshot):** Long-term R&D.
>
> Present the final output as a Markdown table with 4 columns: "Number order in the matrix from 1 to X" "Idea", "Origin Horizon." and "Feasibility ["Quick Wins (Score 3)", "Strategic Projects (Score 2)", and "Moonshots (Score 1)"]"
>
> Execute both parts of this mission now.
> ```

## 3. Field Notes & Best Practices

- **Pro-Tip:** The more detail you provide in your "Step 0" problem description, the more tailored and effective your specialized council members will be.
- **Common Pitfall:** Don't be tempted to judge or filter the ideas during the generation phase. The goal is pure volume. The AI-assisted prioritization in the final step is where you apply critical judgment.
- **Integration Note:** A "Moonshot" idea (Feasibility Score 1) discovered with this protocol is a perfect candidate to be explored more deeply using **"The Cognitive MRI"** to understand its true nature and potential.
